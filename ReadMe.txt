Before start let me told you the reason why we don't upload this on github becuase we have some files that over size for uploading to github.
Our project is English Vcabolary Game. We have Coding Folder and Game Folder Files and one doucumentation file.


1. Code Files Folder this is a our coding file for the game you can open it by using Unity Program (https://unity.com/download). If you are using newest or older version of unity the program will detect version of our project please make sure you download that version so you can open it right now.
